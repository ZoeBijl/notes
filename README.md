## Reading list

Not sure if this is the best way to go about a reading list, but I want to explore the option.

* [ ] [The Stoic of Open Source](http://amasad.me/2016/01/13/the-stoic-of-open-source/) by Amjad Masad
* [ ] [Subgrids Considered Essential](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/) by Eric Meyer
* [x] [Being patient vs. being loud](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marcy-sutton/2015-april-20) by Marcy Sutton
  * “No feedback might reinforce the assumption that ‘the disabled aren’t our audience.’”
  * “Accessibility is something you can build into your workflow.”
  * “In our pursuit to make the web more accessible we can be loud and we can be patient, but no matter what, we must be kind.”
* [ ] [The web accessibility basics](https://www.marcozehe.de/2015/12/14/the-web-accessibility-basics/) by Marco Zehe
* [x] [The accessibility of HTML 5 autofocus](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/the-accessibility-of-html-5-autofocus/) by Bruce Lawson
 * “I believe that autofocussing into a form is a usability win for most people if the purpose of the page is that form.”
 * “Screenreader users find themselves dumped in the middle of a form.”
* [ ] [Building Offline Sites with ServiceWorkers and UpUp](https://dev.opera.com/articles/offline-with-upup-service-workers/)
* [x] [Doesn’t work in lynx](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/02/doesnt-work-lynx/) by Steve Faulkner
* [ ] [Being a deaf developer](http://cruft.io/posts/deep-accessibility/) by Hollie Kay
* [x] [Working with Colour in CSS](http://bitsofco.de/working-with-colour-in-css/) by Ire Aderinokun
 * “HSL is seen as a more intuitive format for colour because we are able to reason what a colour might be just from looking at the numeric value.”

## Watch list

* [ ] [Open Con 2015](http://www.opencon2015.org/resources_opencon2015) (Should pick a couple)
* [ ] [Can you read me lips?](https://vimeo.com/148127830) starring Rachel Kolb 

## ARIA code example

* [Accessible forms with ARIA live regions](http://tink.uk/accessible-forms-with-aria-live-regions/) by Léonie Watson

## ARIA research things

* [What gets focus when form control element is disabled?](https://jsbin.com/qalujo/edit?html,js,console,output) by Rodney Rehm

## Random thoughts

* If you can sleep during take off; you can pretty much sleep anywhere I guess.

## Interesting companies

* [The Paciello Group](http://paciellogroup.com)
* [MartianCraft](http://martiancraft.com/)

## Software

A list of software I use, want to use, or have used, and thoughts on those.

* OS X
 * Has been getting worse (and way to heavy for HDD based Macs) but still offers the best experience for me.
* iTunes
 * Since the iOS 9 update I have replaced iTunes with Spotify on both OS X and iOS.
 * Has screwed me over with weird design choices since 2001…
* Spotify
 * _love_ it, fast, easy, has everything I want (well, most of the time).
* Sublime Text
 * Lack of a “use packages” menu really bugs me. (Maybe there is a package for that).
 * Performance with larger files is good.
* Atom
 * Used thise for about a year and really like it.
 * Performance with larger files is an issue.
* Pixelmator
 * Great product for its price.
 * Lacks some usability / clearity in certain parts.
* Things
 * Maybe it's not the best experience on mobile, but it has served me on both iOS and OS X since 2009.
 * Lack of accessibility in OS X UI. Should report this to them some day (maybe do an audit).
* Clear
 * Lack of contrast on lower priority items really bugs me.
* Safari
 * My favourite browser since 2003.
* Chrome
 * Have been using this more in recent months.
 * Good accessibility tools are a reason to use.
