## Reading list

Not sure if this is the best way to go about a reading list, but I want to explore the option.

* [ ] [The Stoic of Open Source](http://amasad.me/2016/01/13/the-stoic-of-open-source/) by Amjad Masad
* [ ] [Subgrids Considered Essential](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/15/subgrids-considered-essential/) by Eric Meyer
* [x] [Being patient vs. being loud](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/marcy-sutton/2015-april-20) by Marcy Sutton
  * “No feedback might reinforce the assumption that ‘the disabled aren’t our audience.’”
  * “Accessibility is something you can build into your workflow.”
  * “In our pursuit to make the web more accessible we can be loud and we can be patient, but no matter what, we must be kind.”
* [ ] [The web accessibility basics](https://www.marcozehe.de/2015/12/14/the-web-accessibility-basics/) by Marco Zehe
* [x] [The accessibility of HTML 5 autofocus](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/the-accessibility-of-html-5-autofocus/) by Bruce Lawson
  * “I believe that autofocussing into a form is a usability win for most people if the purpose of the page is that form.”
  * “Screenreader users find themselves dumped in the middle of a form.”
* [ ] [Building Offline Sites with ServiceWorkers and UpUp](https://dev.opera.com/articles/offline-with-upup-service-workers/)
* [x] [Doesn’t work in lynx](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2014/02/doesnt-work-lynx/) by Steve Faulkner

* [x] [Working with Colour in CSS](http://bitsofco.de/working-with-colour-in-css/) by Ire Aderinokun
  * “HSL is seen as a more intuitive format for colour because we are able to reason what a colour might be just from looking at the numeric value.”
* [ ] [Privilege and inequality in Silicon Valley](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/privilege-and-inequality-in-silicon-valley-92d455b66860#.2mqjnzwwx) by Ricky Yean
* [ ] [Accessible interfaces (basic recap of WCAG 2.0](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/guides/accessible-interfaces.html)
* [ ] [Accessibility](https://github.com/cfpb/front-end/blob/master/accessibility.md) by Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
* [x] [Sources of Innovation](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/weblog/2011/inside-csswg/input) by fantasai
  * “IMHO, to pretend that useful innovation can only come from one source is to be blind to the reality of crafting a Web standard.”
* [ ] [The W3C is a restaurant](https://longtermlaziness.wordpress.com/2013/10/08/the-w3c-is-a-restaurant/) by David Bruant
* [ ] [Basic screen reader commands for accessibility testing](https://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/01/basic-screen-reader-commands-for-accessibility-testing/) by Léonie Watson
* [x] [Jet-lag study reveals why time changes are a struggle](http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2013-08-30-jet-lag-study-reveals-why-time-changes-are-struggle) by University of Oxford
  * “The SCN receives information from a specialised system in the eyes which senses the time of day by detecting environmental light, and synchronises the clock to local time.”
  * “If you think about it, it makes sense to have a buffering mechanism in place to provide some stability to the clock. The clock needs to be sure that it is getting a reliable signal, and if the signal occurs at the same time over several days it probably has biological relevance.”
  * “More recently, researchers have found that circadian disturbances are a common feature of several mental illnesses, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.”
* [x] [Why I work remotely (hint: it has nothing to do with productivity).](https://m.signalvnoise.com/why-i-work-remotely-hint-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-productivity-34ace30f74fc#.w8a56l8cd) by Jason Zimdars
  * “My son usually goes right for my office when he gets home in the afternoon, standing with me at my desk rattling on about his day oblivious that he might be interrupting. I do my best (and sometimes it’s really hard) to stop what I’m doing, turn to him and be present. How many more of those conversations will there be? I’ll take every one I can get.”
  * “You won’t remember working a little later or catching up on Saturday because the people you love interrupted you but you’re certain to remember those little interactions. And even more, they will remember them, too.”
  * “The people you love aren’t interruptions, they’re the reason you work at all. Give ’em a hug.”
* [x] [Looking at the accessibility of the IRCCloud service](https://www.marcozehe.de/2015/12/07/looking-at-the-accessibility-of-the-irccloud-service/) by Marco Zehe
 * “James was super responsive in adding the appropriate attributes and also adding his own ideas and asking good questions about details here and there.”
 * “Interest and willingness to fix these issues is definitely there, so don’t be shy if you want to use IRCCloud and run into problems!”
* [ ] [Writing resilient unit test](http://engineering.imvu.com/2012/05/08/writing-resilient-unit-tests-3/) by Andrew Wilcox
* [x] [Interview with Jingmai O’Connor on scientific publishing and social media](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822%2815%2901440-2)
  * “I think the idea that scientists need to operate more like a business is becoming a major problem in science recently.”
  * “Pure and unadulterated desire for greater knowledge”
  * “Branding science puts focus on making your research appealing, which is extremely limiting, and — dare I say? — corrupts the scientific process.”
  * “I love collaborating—there is no way individuals can be experts in every field”
  * I disagree with this, but enough has been said about it elsewhere: “Those who can, publish. Those who can’t, blog.”
    * [Who is Jingmai O’Connor, and why is she saying nasty things about science blogggers?](http://neurodojo.blogspot.nl/2016/02/who-is-jingmai-oconnor-and-why-is-she.html)
    * [Chill out about Jingmai O’Connor’s criticism of bloggers (UPDATED)](https://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/2016/02/02/chill-out-about-jingmai-oconnors-criticism-of-bloggers/)
* [x] [Thoughts on screen reader detection](http://tink.uk/thoughts-on-screen-reader-detection/) by Léonie Watson
  * “My disability is personal to me, and I share that information at my discretion.”
  * “Social segregation is a bad idea.”
  * “We’ve spent time turning to web standards and feature detection, instead of browser sniffing”
  * “Most things that make a website usable with a screen reader are achieved by conforming to web standards.”
  * “What is really being discussed is disability detection, and that is a very different thing altogether.”
* [ ] [Why screen reader detection on the web is a bad thing](https://www.marcozehe.de/2014/02/27/why-screen-reader-detection-on-the-web-is-a-bad-thing/) by Marco Zehe
* [x] [Flexbox & the keyboard navigation disconnect](http://tink.uk/flexbox-the-keyboard-navigation-disconnect/) by Léonie Watson
  * “When content is presented in sequence, we expect to read it and navigate through it in a logical order.”
  * “The first reason aria-flowto does not solve the flexbox disconnect, is because it complicates rather than simplifies the problem.”
  * “The CSS “don’t use it” recommendation is unacceptable.”

## Software

A list of software I use, want to use, or have used, and thoughts on those.

* OS X
  * Has been getting worse (and way to heavy for HDD based Macs) but still offers the best experience for me.
* iTunes
  * Since the iOS 9 update I have replaced iTunes with Spotify on both OS X and iOS.
  * Has screwed me over with weird design choices since 2001…
* Spotify
  * _love_ it, fast, easy, has everything I want (well, most of the time).
* Sublime Text
  * Lack of a “use packages” menu really bugs me. (Maybe there is a package for that).
  * Performance with larger files is good.
* Atom
  * Used thise for about a year and really like it.
  * Performance with larger files is an issue.
* Pixelmator
  * Great product for its price.
  * Lacks some usability / clearity in certain parts.
* Things
  * Maybe it's not the best experience on mobile, but it has served me on both iOS and OS X since 2009.
  * Lack of accessibility in OS X UI. Should report this to them some day (maybe do an audit).
* Clear
  * Lack of contrast on lower priority items really bugs me.
* Safari
  * My favourite browser since 2003.
* Chrome
  * Have been using this more in recent months.
  * Good accessibility tools are a reason to use.
* IRCCloud
  * Was recommended to me by Marco Zehe; so accessibility ought to be good.
  * Really like to use it, cleaner interface than something like Gitter or Slack.
  * Well worth the 4 euro/month fee.
  * Comes in very handy for W3C meetings (and on the go).

## Music
