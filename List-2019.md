# Reading List 2019

A list of articles I’ve read or plan to read in 2019.

## Accessibility

- [ ] [Semantics to Screen Readers](https://alistapart.com/article/semantics-to-screen-readers/) by Melanie Richards
	- “there as many ways to browse the web as there are people online”
	- “the rendering engine handles translating web content into information useful to accessibility APIs.”
	- “Accessibility APIs facilitate communicating accessibility information about user interfaces (UIs) to the ATs.”
	- “Accessibility API mappings are maintained on a lower level than web platform APIs, so web developers don’t directly interact with accessibility APIs.”
	- “No matter where they get their information, screen readers can dream up any interaction modes they want to provide to their users”
	- “The accessibility tree is a hierarchical representation of elements in a UI or document, as computed for an accessibility API.”
	- “In modern browsers, the accessibility tree for a given document is a separate, parallel structure to the DOM tree.”
	- “The role tells a user how they can expect to interact with the control.”
	- “The name is an (ideally short) identifier that better helps the user identify and understand the purpose of an accessible object.”
	- “The Description can be considered supplemental to the Name; it’s not the main identifier but can provide further information about the accessible object.”
	- “properties can include details like layout information or available interactions”
