- [x] üìº [Head Pointer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL0x-b6zZ8Y) by Christopher Hills
	- This is so cool!
- [x] [Content on hover & focus](https://accessuse.eu/en/Content-hover-focus.html)
	- Often, pop-up content acts as a custom tooltip, explaining the meaning of an icon, or expanding an abbreviation.
	- Content that pops up on hover or focus is often problematic for people with low vision who use strong zoom magnification
	- When people use magnification software, the visible magnified section is often positioned so theat the mouse cursor of the keyboard-focused element is right at the centre. If content pops up and users want to **dismiss it**, they may not see a **control for dismissal**.
	- it is important to be able to dismiss pop-up content without having to move the current focus. _**Note:** this is also a WCAG 2.1 requirement_
	- pop-up content is often larger than the currently visible enlarged section
	- it [a pop-up] must remain visible until it is deliberately dismissed by the user
	- When a pop-up covers part of the orignal content, people lose context
	- Make sure the pointer can be moved over the popup content

	- Accessibility should always be a focus when designing products
	- Accessible graphs ... translate into better understandable graphs for everyone.
	- ...in medical software, inaccessible or confusing graphs could lead to critical mistakes such as giving the wrong medication to a patient
	- [hiding information behind hovers](https://accessuse.eu/en/Content-hover-focus.html) can be bad for accessibility as well
	- It was just written out for us in easy-to-understand English sentences, as if a person was explaining it to us.
	- Amongst other things, [gov.uk](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) [red] recommend explaining things to help people with anxiety, and writing in plain language to help people who are D/deaf or on the autism spectrum.
